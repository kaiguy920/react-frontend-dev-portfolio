    "description": "Iâ€™ve been working within the health and wellness industry for 7+ years, wearing many hats that have included leadership roles, marketing strategy, sales, branding, and more. I have a tract record of being a key contributor in a team setting and exceeding expectations. Given my background and skill sets, I am pivoting my career focus to software engineering, to leverage my career path in an industry that has proven time and again its value in being an essential component to business and society. Outside of my time enjoying learning more about my new trade, I prioritize my health through staying active at the gym or outdoors. I have arguably the most adorable dog and cat pair as well!",

Views can be indexed by the user or searched by the # associated with looks. This was a great, fun way to show of many documents and subdocs in a many-to-many relationship. I also chose to work in a pairing on this, which was a great way to communicate through a project and replicate a team dynamic on a another project.",

I took on the role as primary organizer/communicator to ensure we divised out tasks evenly and punctually. I really enjoyed working the back end routes and working in a team dynamic. ",
